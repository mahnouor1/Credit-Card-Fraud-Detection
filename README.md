This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The study explores an imbalanced dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing various features related to transaction and payment histories. The methodology involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), dimensionality reduction using PCA, and model training using the XGBoost algorithm. The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean F1-Score. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, providing insights into combating financial fraud.
